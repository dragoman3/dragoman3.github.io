<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Pain management can be a complex topic in anesthesia. Patient factors, like age, comorbidities, and pre-existing chronic pain can help guide analgesia during the operative period. Surgical factors, like the expected intra-operative and post-operative pain can also help determine which agents to use and in what dosage.</p>

<p>Consider pre-operative [[Acetaminophen]]
  Consider the use of [[NSAID]]s, but this will depend on the type of surgery. Generally, NSAIDs are given at the end of an operation if hemostasis is adequate and concerns of bleeding are low.</p>
<ul>
  <li>[[Ibuprofen]]</li>
  <li>[[Ketorolac]]
    <h2 id="opioids">Opioids</h2>
    <p>Opioids are the workhorse of analgesia in the perioperative period. Each of the opioids has a different onset of action and duration of action. The degree of analgesia (determined by the choice and dose of opioid) should be matched to the expected stimulus of the operations.</p>

<p>[[Tramadol]] can be used after surgery and is commonly prescribed because it does not require a triplicate.</p>
<h2 id="multimodal-analgesia">Multimodal Analgesia</h2>
<p>There are a variety of co-analgesic options that can be infused or bolused throughout the operation. A few options include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>[[Ketamine]]</li>
  <li>Lidocaine</li>
  <li>Dexmedetomidine</li>
  <li>Magnesium</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="regional-anesthesia">Regional Anesthesia</h2>
<p>Depending on the operation, there are a variety of single shot and catheter based regional techniques that can provide intra-operative and post-operative pain control. A few options include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Spinal anesthesia – used commonly in c-secitons</li>
  <li>Epidural anesthesia – used in labouring patients and laparotomies</li>
  <li>Adductor canal nerve blocks – used in some knee and lower extremity surgeries</li>
  <li>Interscalene nerve block – can be useful for surgery surgery</li>
</ol>
