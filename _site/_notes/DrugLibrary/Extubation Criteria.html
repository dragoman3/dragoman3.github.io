<h2 id="airway">Airway</h2>
<p><em>Ensure the patient will be able to protect their own airway and that airway recapture is possible</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>protective reflexes are present (cough, gag)</li>
  <li>cuff leak is present (generally after long cases, surgeries near the neck, or [[Trendelenburg]] position)</li>
  <li>reintubation or ventilation is feasible (the difficulty of intubation can dictate how conservative extubation must be)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breathing">Breathing</h2>
<p><em>Ensure the patient's respiratory drive is adequate for maintaining oxygenation and ventilation</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>the patient is <strong>triggering</strong> the ventilator</li>
  <li>the patient is drawing adequate tidal volumes and minute ventilation</li>
  <li>the patient is triggering the ventilator at an appropriate respiratory rate (often targeting RR 10-12 at the end of a case)</li>
  <li>the patient has adequate gas exchange</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="circulation">Circulation</h2>
<p><em>Ensure that the patient's hemodynamics are stable enough for extubation</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>change from positive pressure ventilation to negative pressure will be tolerated well
    <ul>
      <li>especially important in cardiac pathology and pulmonary hypertension</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>added work of breathing will be tolerated hemodynamically
    <h2 id="disabilitydrugs">Disability/Drugs</h2>
    <p><em>Ensure the patient has a level of consciousness that is amenable to extubation. Similarly, ensure there are no drugs in the patient's system that may cause them to fail extubation</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>reversal of neuromuscular blockers (train of four &gt; 90%)</li>
  <li>adequate analgesia on board</li>
  <li>condition requiring intubation has been resolved (if intubated in a non-elective setting)</li>
  <li>there is no patient condition that requires control of ventilation (ex. TBI protocol necessitates avoiding hypercapnia)</li>
</ul>
