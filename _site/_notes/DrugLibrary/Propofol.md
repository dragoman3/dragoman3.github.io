## Pharmacokinetics of Propofol

2,6-diisopropylphenol

- formulation
    - 1% aqueous solution
    - oil water emulsion containing
        - soya bean oil, glycerol, egg licthin
- Action
    - Short initial distribution half life (2-8 min)
    - Elimination half life 4-7 hours due to
        - distribution to fatty tissue
- Metabolism
    - Liver via conjugation to:
        - glucuronide and sulphate which are excreted by
            - kidneys
    - Extrahepatic metabolism
- Context sensitive half life (infusion up to 8 hrs)
    - 40 min

## Pharmacodynamics

- Cardiovascular
    - SVR
        - Reduces
    - Contractility
        - reduces
    - Preload
        - reduces
    - Heart Rate
        - increases (baroreceptor mediated)
- Respiratory
    - profound respiratory depression
    - upper airway reflexes reduced
- Cerebral
    - CMR
        - reduces
    - CBF
        - reduces
    - Intracranial pressure
        - down
    - Anticonvulsant properties
        - at infusions
        - excititory in bolus
        - ~
- Hepatic
	- Does not decrease hepatic blood flow (may increase)
