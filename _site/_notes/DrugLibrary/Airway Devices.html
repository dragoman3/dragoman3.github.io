<p>Useful for maintaining airway patency
  Sizing: corner of mouth to angle of mandible
  Contraindications: beware in pediatrics (due to incompletely formed hard palate)</p>
<h3 id="nasopharyngeal-airway">Nasopharyngeal Airway</h3>
<p>Also known as a nasal trumpet
  Used to maintain airway patency
  Sizing: tip of nose to earlobe
  Contraindications: <strong>Basal skull fracture</strong>, patients likely to have epistaxis (relative)</p>
<h1 id="laryngeal-mask-airway">Laryngeal Mask Airway</h1>
<p>A supraglottic (does not pass below vocal cords) airway device which can be used to maintain an airway under anesthesia or in an emergency situation. These devices do not provide the level of seal that an ETT does</p>
<h2 id="indications">Indications</h2>
<ul>
  <li>anesthetic cases with:
    <ul>
      <li>good access to the airway (to swap to ETT, if needed)</li>
      <li>positioning amenable to low airway pressures</li>
      <li>generally, no laparopscopic component</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Patients at risk of laryngospasm/bronchospasm
    <ul>
      <li>less invasive and provoking than an ETT

    <h1 id="endotracheal-tube">Endotracheal Tube</h1>
    <h2 id="placement">Placement</h2>
    <p>Standard endotracheal tubes are placed below the level of the vocal cords under direct vision.
      On x-ray, the tube tip should sit 2-4 cm above the carina.
      A rule of thumb for the depth of tube is:
      \(Depth = 3\times Tube~Diameter\)</p>
    <h2 id="sizing-1">Sizing</h2>
    <p>Tube diameter is generally selected with the following rule for cuffed tubes:
      \(Tube~Diameter = (age + 4)/4\)</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="rae-tubes">RAE tubes</h3>
<p>Stands for: Ring, Adair, Elwyn
  Charicteristic bend removes tube and circuit from surgical field
  Useful in: Sinus surgery, facial surgery
  Special considerations: Fixed length from bend to tip of tube can impair proper tube placement below glottis</p>
<h3 id="nasal-rae">Nasal RAE</h3>
<p>Special Considerations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed length from bend to tip of tube can impair proper tube placement below glottis</li>

<p>Generally cuffed tubes are used unless in very small pediatric populations</p>
