<ul>
  <li>General anesthesia usually involves impairment of airway reflexes, thereby increasing aspiration risk</li>
  <li>If patients who require general anesthesia are at a higher risk of gastric aspiration during the perioperative phase, rapid sequence induction can be performed to reduce risk of aspiration</li>
  <li>RSI entails advanced airway techniques, use of pharmacology knowledge and intubation to safely induce general anesthesia</li>
  <li>Planning and preparation ahead of performing the technique is crucial for safety</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indications-">Indications <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></h2>
<h4 id="patients-with-predisposed-risk-factors-for-aspiration-including">Patients with predisposed risk factors for aspiration including:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>aLOC - substances, TBI, shock, trauma</li>
  <li>Impaired airway reflexes - aLOC, prolonged intubation, local airway anesthesia, CVA</li>
  <li>Increased intragastric pressure - full stomach, bowel obstruction, obesity, pregnancy</li>
  <li>Delayed gastric emptying - medications, narcotics, pregnancy, diabetes (neuropathy)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="steps-for-rsi-">Steps for RSI <sup id="fnref:1:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preoxygenation - increases reserve prior to induction, paralysis and intubation as it allows for longer periods of apnea</li>
  <li>Cricoid pressure - sustained until the airway is secured with an ETT, this prevents gastric contents from entering the airway</li>
  <li>Administer IV anesthetics and muscle relaxants - neuromuscular blockade achieved with either succinylcholine or rocuronium, most common induction agent is propofol, can also use other agents such as opioids (fentanyl), benzodiazepine (midazolam), lidocaine</li>
  <li>Endotracheal intubation - inflated cuff is crucial, preparation ensures proper placement with the first attempt</li>
  <li>Confirmation of ETT placement - visualization of the tube passing between the vocal cords, chest rise, EtCO2, auscultation for bilateral equal breath sounds
    <h4 id="modified-rsi">Modified RSI:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Some clinicians do not opt to apply cricoid pressure as it has sometimes observed to be ineffective</li>
      <li>Although BMV is avoided in patients undergoing RSI, if they are at risk of rapid desaturation then they may benefit from BMV.</li>
