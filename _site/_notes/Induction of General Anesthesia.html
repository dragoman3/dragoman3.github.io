<p><em>The start of a case represents one of the highest risk periods in the operation.</em></p>
<p>After a surgical time-out, the tools required for a safe induction can be remembered with the <em>MDSOLES</em> acronym:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monitors</li>
  <li>Drugs
    <ul>
      <li>IV access</li>
      <li>induction agents</li>
      <li>resuscitation medications (vasopressors, reversal agents)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Suction</li>
  <li>Oxygen (primary and alternative source)</li>
  <li>Laryngoscope</li>

<h1 id="goals-of-induction">Goals of Induction</h1>
<h2 id="loss-of-consciousness">Loss of consciousness</h2>
<p><em>Anesthetic agents are administered until the patient loses consciousness. The speed at which anesthesia is induced is often guided by the clinical scenario and patient comorbidities (see [[Rapid Sequence Induction]])</em></p>
<p>Tests of loss of consciousness:</p>
<ul>
  <li>loss of verbal or pain response</li>
  <li>loss of eyelash reflex</li>
  <li>apnea (often used when using [[Propofol]] or other apnea-inducing agents)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hemodynamic-stability">Hemodynamic Stability</h2>
<p><em>There are many factors that contribute to hemodynamic depression and elevation. Hypotension is a common side effect of anesthetic agents and should be expected and counteracted. Similarly, laryngoscopy can be quite stimulating and achieving sympathetic blockade with narcotics or other medications is standard.</em></p>
<p>Factors causing hypotension:</p>
<ul>
  <li>anesthetic agents &amp; analgesics</li>
  <li>administration of positive pressure ventilation (due to reducing preload)</li>
  <li>patient positioning (head up reduces preload, head down will augment preload)</li>
</ul>
<p>Factors causing hypertension</p>
<ul>
  <li>jaw thrust</li>
  <li>laryngoscopy</li>
  <li>surgical incision</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="facilitation-of-airway-management">Facilitation of Airway Management</h2>
<p><em>Depending on the desired airway, there are a variety of medications that can assist in placement of an airway device.</em>
  See [[Airway Devices]]</p>
<h3 id="endotracheal-tube">Endotracheal Tube</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Paralysis with [[Succinylcholine]] or [[Rocuronium]] is common</li>
  <li>Narcotics like [[Remifentanil]] or [[Fentanyl]] can improve the grade of the view during laryngoscopy and prevent the hemodynamic impact of laryngoscopy</li>
  <li>Adequate depth of anesthetic can facilitate intubation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supraglottic-airway">Supraglottic Airway</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Depth of anesthetic is important for placement of an SGA</li>
  <li>Paralysis and narcotics can be used to facilitate SGA placement but paralysis is often unnecessary</li>
</ul>
