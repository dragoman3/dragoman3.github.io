<ul>
  <li>General anesthesia usually involves impairment of airway reflexes, thereby increasing aspiration risk</li>
  <li>If patients who require general anesthesia are at a higher risk of gastric aspiration during the perioperative phase, rapid sequence induction can be performed to reduce risk of aspiration</li>
  <li>An RSI revolves around minimizing the time from loss of airway to protection to securement of a definitive airway (endotracheal tube). This is achieved through rapid administration of induction agents and paralytics.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A classic indication for an RSI is a patient coming to the operating room for a small bowel obstruction.</em></p>
<h2 id="indications-">Indications <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Increased intragastric pressure or delayed gastric emptying - full stomach, pregnancy, medications delaying gastric emptying, diabetic neuropathy</li>
  <li>Altered level of alertness with impaired airway reflexes - substances, TBI, shock, trauma, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="contraindications">Contraindications</h2>
<p>The main detriments to an RSI include hemodynamic changes and the commitment to asleep airway management.</p>
<h3 id="hemodynamic-instability">Hemodynamic Instability</h3>
<p>Induction agents like [[Propofol]] cause hypotension. Here are some steps to mitigate the hemodynamic response to an RSI:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Continue fluid resuscitation prior to induction</li>
  <li>Bolus vasopressors with induction</li>
  <li>Infusions of vasopressors along with induction</li>
  <li>Be ready to reposition patient after induction to head down (unless contraindicated)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="airway-management">Airway Management</h3>
<p>Plans and backup plans for airway management should be made prior to the induction of anesthetic</p>
<h2 id="steps-for-rsi-">Steps for RSI <sup id="fnref:1:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preoxygenation - this should be done with a good mask seal to maximize apneic time</li>
  <li>Cricoid pressure - pressure on the esophagus is thought to reduce the risk of aspiration from gastric contents. Pressure is held until confirmation of tube placement. Evidence on the effeciveness of cricoid pressure is mixed, and generally should be relieved if it is interfering with intubation.</li>
  <li>Administer IV anesthetics and muscle relaxants - neuromuscular blockade achieved with either succinylcholine or rocuronium. See [[Induction of General Anesthesia]].</li>
  <li>Endotracheal intubation - inflated cuff is crucial, preparation ensures proper placement with the first attempt</li>
  <li>Confirmation of ETT placement - visualization of the tube passing between the vocal cords, chest rise, EtCO2, auscultation for bilateral equal breath sounds</li>
  <li>Removal of cricoid pressure</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, hemodynamics are managed simultaneously during this procedure (consider delegating management).</p>
