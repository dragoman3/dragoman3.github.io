Steps for RSI 1 . | Preoxygenation - increases reserve prior to induction, paralysis and intubation as it allows for longer periods of apnea | Cricoid pressure - sustained until the airway is secured with an ETT, this prevents gastric contents from entering the airway | Administer IV anesthetics and muscle relaxants - neuromuscular blockade achieved with either succinylcholine or rocuronium, most common induction agent is propofol, can also use other agents such as opioids (fentanyl), benzodiazepine (midazolam), lidocaine | Endotracheal intubation - inflated cuff is crucial, preparation ensures proper placement with the first attempt | Confirmation of ETT placement - visualization of the tube passing between the vocal cords, chest rise, EtCO2, auscultation for bilateral equal breath sounds Modified RSI: . | Some clinicians do not opt to apply cricoid pressure as it has sometimes observed to be ineffective | Although BMV is avoided in patients undergoing RSI, if they are at risk of rapid desaturation then they may benefit from BMV. | . | .

Mechanism of Action &amp;amp; Pharmacokinetics 1 2 . | There is no confirmed mechanism of action | Theories include that it activates GABA receptors and inhibits calcium channels or glutamate channels. | The volume expansion theory also details that the volatile anesthetic dissolves into the lipid cell membranes within the CNS and can distort sodium channels required for synaptic transmission. | . | ![sevo mechanism | 300](https://www.sciencerepository.org/resources/uploads/2020/anesthesia-the-gamechanger_2.jpg) | . Pharmacodynamics 1 2 . Cardiovascular . | Dose-related reduction in blood pressure due to a decrease in SVR and no reduction in cardiac output. Respiratory . | Has bronchodilation properties so can be used to treat individuals with status asthmaticus. | Less likely to elicit airway irritation symptoms such as coughing and laryngospasm compared to desflurane and isoflurane due to low pungency. | . Central Nervous System . | Dose-related vasodilatory effects of cerebral vasculature so it increases cerebral blood flow and ICP. | . Other . | Known to produce uterine relaxation which can be used in specific cases such as retained placenta but can be detrimental during other procedures such as a D&amp;amp;C. | . Indications 1 . | Used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. | Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is used to compare the potencies between various volatile agents. | . Complications 1 2 . | Should not be used for anesthetic management in patients with known history of malignant hyperthermia or suspected susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. | Increased risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting compared to intravenous anesthetic agents. | .

The goal of this project is to provide condense, useful educational resources that can be used during anesthesia rotations and beyond. Several formats of resources exist, including clinical practice flowcharts, topic pocket cards, and a pharmacy section. classDiagram Animal &amp;lt;|-- Duck Animal &amp;lt;|-- Fish Animal &amp;lt;|-- Zebra Animal : +int age Animal : +String gender Animal: +isMammal() Animal: +mate() Animal : Testing class Duck{ +String beakColor +swim() +quack() } class Fish{ -int sizeInFeet -canEat() } class Zebra{ +bool is_wild +run() } . flowchart LR A[Node 1] --&amp;gt; B[&quot;Node 2:\\nfa:fa-genderless font-awesome\\nfa:fa-caret-right fa arrow\\n#8226; html code\\n#bull; html named\\n• Unicode&quot;]; style B text-align:left; .",
