"title": "Pain Management",
"content": "Introduction . Pain management can be a complex topic in anesthesia. Patient factors, like age, comorbidities, and pre-existing chronic pain can help guide analgesia during the operative period. Surgical factors, like the expected intra-operative and post-operative pain can also help determine which agents to use and in what dosage. Definitions . | Multimodal Analgesia - use of different classes of drugs to optimize analgesia while minimizing individual drug side-effects | . WHO Pain Ladder . The classic WHO pain ladder can be a useful reference when considering pain management in any patient. graph TB A[Foundational Analgesics]; B[Tramadol &amp;amp; Low Dose Opioids]; C[Hydromorphone, Morphine, Oxycodone]; D[Fentanyl Patch, Extended Release Opioids] A--&amp;gt;B B--&amp;gt;C C--&amp;gt;D . Analgesia Overview . Maximize Non-opioid Analgesia . Consider pre-operative [[Acetaminophen]] Consider the use of [[NSAID]]s, but this will depend on the type of surgery. Generally, NSAIDs are given at the end of an operation if hemostasis is adequate and concerns of bleeding are low. | Ibuprofen | [[Ketorolac]] Opioids . Opioids are the workhorse of analgesia in the perioperative period. Each of the opioids has a different onset of action and duration of action. The degree of analgesia (determined by the choice and dose of opioid) should be matched to the expected stimulus of the operations. | . For instance, [[Remifentanil]] is a good choice in operations that have brief, potent stimulation but minimal post-operative pain. [[Hydromorphone]] and [[Morphine]] are good choices when there is intra-operative and post-operative pain. [[Tramadol]] can be used after surgery and is commonly prescribed because it does not require a triplicate. Multimodal Analgesia . There are a variety of co-analgesic options that can be infused or bolused throughout the operation. A few options include: . | [[Ketamine]] | Lidocaine | Dexmedetomidine | Magnesium | . Regional Anesthesia . Depending on the operation, there are a variety of single shot and catheter based regional techniques that can provide intra-operative and post-operative pain control. A few options include: . | Spinal anesthesia – used commonly in c-secitons | Epidural anesthesia – used in labouring patients and laparotomies | Adductor canal nerve blocks – used in some knee and lower extremity surgeries | Interscalene nerve block – can be useful for surgery surgery | .",

"content": "What is a Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI)? 1 . | General anesthesia usually involves impairment of airway reflexes, thereby increasing aspiration risk | If patients who require general anesthesia are at a higher risk of gastric aspiration during the perioperative phase, rapid sequence induction can be performed to reduce risk of aspiration | An RSI revolves around minimizing the time from loss of airway to protection to securement of a definitive airway (endotracheal tube). This is achieved through rapid administration of induction agents and paralytics. | . A classic indication for an RSI is a patient coming to the operating room for a small bowel obstruction. Indications 1 . | Increased intragastric pressure or delayed gastric emptying - full stomach, pregnancy, medications delaying gastric emptying, diabetic neuropathy | Altered level of alertness with impaired airway reflexes - substances, TBI, shock, trauma, etc. | . Contraindications . The main detriments to an RSI include hemodynamic changes and the commitment to asleep airway management. Hemodynamic Instability . Induction agents like [[Propofol]] cause hypotension. Here are some steps to mitigate the hemodynamic response to an RSI: . | Continue fluid resuscitation prior to induction | Bolus vasopressors with induction | Infusions of vasopressors along with induction | Be ready to reposition patient after induction to head down (unless contraindicated) | . Airway Management . Plans and backup plans for airway management should be made prior to the induction of anesthetic . Steps for RSI 1 . | Preoxygenation - this should be done with a good mask seal to maximize apneic time | Cricoid pressure - pressure on the esophagus is thought to reduce the risk of aspiration from gastric contents. Pressure is held until confirmation of tube placement. Evidence on the effeciveness of cricoid pressure is mixed, and generally should be relieved if it is interfering with intubation. | Administer IV anesthetics and muscle relaxants - neuromuscular blockade achieved with either succinylcholine or rocuronium. See [[Induction of General Anesthesia]]. | Endotracheal intubation - inflated cuff is crucial, preparation ensures proper placement with the first attempt | Confirmation of ETT placement - visualization of the tube passing between the vocal cords, chest rise, EtCO2, auscultation for bilateral equal breath sounds | Removal of cricoid pressure | . Generally, hemodynamics are managed simultaneously during this procedure (consider delegating management). References . | Sullivan, P. (2012). Ottawa Anesthesia Primer.

"content": "Ventilator Basics . There are a variety of methods to ventilate patients in the OR once an [[Airway Devices|Airway]] is placed. As the name suggests, controlled modes of ventilation allow the anesthesiologist to set ventilator parameters which will be delivered to the patient. These modes are best if the patient is not interacting with the ventilator (paralyzed, deep anesthetic, strong analgesia). Supportive modes can augment patient&#39;s ventilatory efforts which can be useful in unparalyzed patients or those weaning from the ventilator. Spontaneous modes of ventilation require the patient to provide all of the ventilatory work (with the exception of some CPAP).

"content": "What is Tramadol? 1 . | Synthetic opioid with analgesic properties indicated for treatment of moderate-severe pain. | Can be administered orally as immediate release or extended release tablets or as a liquid formulation. | . Mechanism of Action &amp;amp; Pharmacokinetics 12 . | Atypical synthetic opioid with synergistic opioid and non-opioid effects. Activates both the μ-opioid and monoamine receptor systems: . | Opioid: Selectively binds to opiate receptors in the central nervous system. Tramadol is broken down to active metabolite M1 by liver enzyme CYP2D6. M1 is a more potent analgesic with stronger affinity for opiate receptors. | Non-opioid/SNRI + SSRI: The two enantiomers of tramadol each independently inhibit norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, which activate the inhibitory descending pathway - producing an antinociceptive effect with alteration of pain perception. | . | Tramadol and its M1 metabolite reach maximum plasma concentration in 2 and 3 hours with a half-life of and 6 and 8 hours, respectively. | Metabolized by liver enzymes through conjugation and metabolites are primarily renally excreted. | . Dosage 13 . | Extended release: 100, 200, or 300 mg tablet once daily. | Immediate release: 50 mg tablet or 5 mg/ml solution. | Acute pain: 50-100 mg every 4-6 hours with a daily maximum of 400 mg/d. | . | . Indications 12 . | Moderate to severe pain. Commonly used postoperatively. | Extended release: pain lasting longer than a week. | Immediate release: pain lasting less than a week, and not to be used &quot;as needed&quot; but rather with scheduling dosing. | . Adverse effects 12 3 . | As with other opiates, risk for development of tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, and abuse. | Opioid side effects: nausea, pruritus, constipation, headache, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, sedation, respiratory depression, and death. | Non-opioid effects: risk of seizures and serotonin syndrome especially when used with other drugs that act on the serotonergic system such as monoamine inhibitors. | Tramadol can cross the placenta and should be minimized in pregnancy to prevent fetal opioid exposure. | .
