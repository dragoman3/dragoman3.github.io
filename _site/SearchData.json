"title": "Rapid Sequence Induction",
"content": "What is RSI? 1 . | General anesthesia usually involves impairment of airway reflexes, thereby increasing aspiration risk | If patients who require general anesthesia are at a higher risk of gastric aspiration during the perioperative phase, rapid sequence induction can be performed to reduce risk of aspiration | RSI entails advanced airway techniques, use of pharmacology knowledge and intubation to safely induce general anesthesia | Planning and preparation ahead of performing the technique is crucial for safety | . Indications 1 . Patients with predisposed risk factors for aspiration including: . | aLOC - substances, TBI, shock, trauma | Impaired airway reflexes - aLOC, prolonged intubation, local airway anesthesia, CVA | Increased intragastric pressure - full stomach, bowel obstruction, obesity, pregnancy | Delayed gastric emptying - medications, narcotics, pregnancy, diabetes (neuropathy) | . Steps for RSI 1 . | Preoxygenation - increases reserve prior to induction, paralysis and intubation as it allows for longer periods of apnea | Cricoid pressure - sustained until the airway is secured with an ETT, this prevents gastric contents from entering the airway | Administer IV anesthetics and muscle relaxants - neuromuscular blockade achieved with either succinylcholine or rocuronium, most common induction agent is propofol, can also use other agents such as opioids (fentanyl), benzodiazepine (midazolam), lidocaine | Endotracheal intubation - inflated cuff is crucial, preparation ensures proper placement with the first attempt | Confirmation of ETT placement - visualization of the tube passing between the vocal cords, chest rise, EtCO2, auscultation for bilateral equal breath sounds Modified RSI: . | Some clinicians do not opt to apply cricoid pressure as it has sometimes observed to be ineffective | Although BMV is avoided in patients undergoing RSI, if they are at risk of rapid desaturation then they may benefit from BMV. | . | .
