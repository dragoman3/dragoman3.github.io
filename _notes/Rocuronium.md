## What is Rocuronium? [^1]
- An intermediate-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug (NDMR) used for rapid induction and intubation.
- Popular for short and intermediate procedures due to its rapid onset and ability to induce neuromuscular block quickly.

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Rocuronium competitively binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This prevents ACh from causing muscle contraction
- Onset time is 60-80 seconds for an intubating dose (approximately 0.6 mg/kg).
- Duration of action: 35-45 minutes.
- Dosage is typically based on **ideal body weight (IBW)** for intubation. [^2]

## Pharmacodynamics [^1]
### Cardiovascular
- Few cardiovascular effects.
### Respiratory
- Paralysis impairs airway protection and respiration. Reversal of paralysis must be achieved prior to airway removal.
### Neurological
- Adequate depth of anesthesia must be maintained to minimize the risk of awareness during paralysis.

## Indications [^1]
- [[DrugLibrary/Rapid Sequence Induction|Rapid Sequence Induction]] and intubation (opens vocal cords, improves laryngoscopy view).
- Maintenance of neuromuscular block during surgery.
- Alternative to succinylcholine in situations where a rapid onset is required without the associated side effects of depolarizing agents.

## Dosage [^1]
- **Intubation Dose:** 0.6 mg/kg based on **ideal body weight (IBW)**, 1.2 mg/kg for rapid sequence intubation based on **ideal body weight (IBW)**.
- **Maintenance Infusion:** Dose adjusted based on **lean body weight (LBW)** to avoid prolonged neuromuscular block, particularly in obese patients. [^2]

## Contraindications [^1]
- Hypersensitivity to rocuronium or any component of the formulation.
- Use with caution in patients with known neuromuscular disorders.

## Complications [^1]
- Prolonged neuromuscular block, especially in patients with renal impairment.
- Anaphylaxis, though rare, has been reported.
