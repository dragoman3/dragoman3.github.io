# Introduction
*This page will cover the basics of an anesthetic evaluation*

# History of Presenting Illness
- Identify the proposed surgery and approach (e.g. laparoscopic, open, etc.)
- Identify the key points of their presentation
- What treatments have been initiated and what has been the response
- Address the urgency of the case (elective, urgency, emergency)
- Is the patient NPO ([Fasting Requirements](Fasting%20Requirements))

# Past Medical History & Review of Systems
*Determine the etiology, severity, treatments, and complications of any medical history*

- CNS
	- strokes
	- seizure
- Cardiovascular
	- CAD
	- HTN
	- Rhythm issues
	- Valvular issues
	- Functional status (> 4 metabolic equivalents is generally acceptable)
- Respiratory
	- Smoking history
	- Asthma / COPD
	- Recent infections
	- OSA
- GI
	- GERD
	- Liver Dysfunction
- Renal
	- Acute or chronic injury
- Endocrine
	- Diabetes
	- Thyroid issues
- Hematologic
	- Problems with bleeding or clotting
	- Contraindications to blood products
- Spinal deformities
	- 
- Review of systems geared towards uncovering any additional comorbidities
	- Smoking, alcohol use, drug use

# Past Anesthetic & Surgical History
- Review previous anesthetic records if available
- Review previous airway management (BMV, intubation, LMA)
- Review previous anesthetic reactions ([[Post-operative Nausea and Vomiting]], Malignant Hyperthermia)

# Physical Exam
## [[Airway Assessment]]
- Mouth opening, neck ROM, Mallampati score, thyromental distance, jaw prognathism
- Dentition status, dentures, loose/chipped teeth
- Facial hair

## Cardiac
- Murmurs, extra heart sounds, JVP, edema
- Peripheral pulses and IV access

## Respiratory
- Current oxygen requirements
- Lung sounds

## Other Systems
- Abdominal & neurological examination as needed
- ease of IV access

# Medications
- Document which medications the patient takes at home and their last dose 
- Look for recent antibiotic administration
- Always look for antiplatelets and anticoagulants and their most recent dose

# Allergies
- Document any allergies and their reactions

# Investigations
*Not every patient requires investigations prior to proceeding to the OR, but their historic values can be quite useful.*

## Labwork:
*Look for labwork to further evaluate comorbidities. Some basic labs to review include:*
- Hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cell count
- INR, PTT
- Electrolytes, extended electrolytes
- Renal function
- BNP, troponin if applicable

## ECG:
- Baseline ECG

## Imaging:
*Directed at comorbidities*
- Echos and PFTs
- CT scans, chest x-rays if available

# Anesthetic Plan
*Synthesize the information above to answer the following questions.*

- What anesthetic options are possible here:
   - General anesthetic with endotracheal tube ([[Airway Devices#Endotracheal Tube]])
   - General anesthetic with LMA [[Airway Devices#Laryngeal Mask Airway]]
   - Sedation
   - Regional anesthesia +/- sedation
   - Spinal or epidural anesthesia

- Will this patient tolerate an anesthetic? What therapies can be included to ensure the patient can tolerate the anesthetic plan? (vasopressors, supplemental oxygen, sedation)

- If the airway is not captured in our plan, would it be easy to secure the airway midway through the case?

- What is my allowable blood loss? What is this patient's baseline fluid requirement? ([[Fluid Management in Anesthesia]])

- What is my analgesic plan for this patient? [[Pain Management]]
