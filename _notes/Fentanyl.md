## What is Fentanyl? [^1][^2]
- Potent, synthetic opioid with rapid acting analgesic and sedative properties.
- Can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, transdermally, transmucosally, or intrathecally.

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2][^3]
- Primarily agonizes mu-opioid receptors, with additional activity on delta and kappa receptors.
	- The mu receptor is predominantly responsible for analgesia, hypoventilation, and euphoria
	- The kappa receptor is involved in analgesia, dysphoria
	- The delta receptor is involved in constipation and urinary retention
- Fentanyl is highly *lipophilic* and rapidly redistributes into fat/muscle
- Peak effect in **3-5 minutes** with a duration of 0.5-1 hours.
- Metabolized via the hepatic system to inactive metabolites which get excreted largely in the urine. 
- Infusions of fentanyl lead to accumulation causing a high *context sensitive half-life*

## Pharmacodynamics

### Cardiovascular [^2]
- May decrease heart rate and blood pressure as a result of sympathectomy

### Respiratory [^1][^3]
- With increasing doses, fentanyl can cause respiratory depression, hypoxia, apnea, loss of consciousness, and respiratory arrest without adequate ventilation support. 
- Depresses respiratory centers in the brainstem, leading to decreased respiratory rate and minute ventilation. Often intially compensatory increased tidal volume occurs [^3]
- Risk of respiratory depression increases with dose and concomitant use of other CNS depressants.
- Occasional chest wall rigidity or laryngeal rigidity can make ventilation difficult

### Central Nervous System [^1][^2] 
- Euphoria, drowsiness, delirium, and hallucinations. 

## Indications [^1][^2] 
- Preoperative and postoperative [[Pain Management]] 
- Blunts sympathetic response during laryngoscopy
- Procedural sedation and analgesia
- Potentiates neuraxial analgesia when given into the CSF during spinal anesthesia

## Dosing [^1][^3] 
- General anesthesia: 
	- Induction: 1-2 mcg/kg (variable dosing)
- Synergizes with other sedative agents

## Complications  [^1][^2][^3]
- Common side effects include nasal pruritus, urinary retention, and constipation.
- As above, severe respiratory depression and decreased level of consciousness can occur
