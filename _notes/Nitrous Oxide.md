## What is Nitrous Oxide?
- Inhalational agent used for general anesthetic induction. Combined with other drugs to augment an anesthetic and analgesic effect. 

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Nitrous oxide exhibits non-competitive inhibitive effects on the NMDA receptors in the CNS for an anesthetic effect.
- Analgesic effects are through a release of endogenous opioids acting on opioid receptors.
- By acting on GABA-A receptors, nitrous oxide also exhibits anxiolytic properties. 

## Pharmacodynamics [^1] [^2] [^3][^4]
#### Cardiovascular
- Mildly increases heart rate secondary to slight adrenergic stimulation.
#### Respiratory
- There is minimal effect on minute ventilation. 
- Compared to other agents, it does not cause bronchodilation. 
#### Central Nervous System
- Acts on receptors in the CNS - NMDA, GABA-A, Mu opioid receptors. 
- Increases cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate and intracranial pressure. 

## Indications  [^1] [^3]
#### Anesthetic Indications
- Can be mixed in with volatile agents like [[DrugLibrary/Sevoflurane|Sevoflurane]] for [[Induction of General Anesthesia]] and will speed the onset of anesthesia 

#### Other Indications
- Anxiolytic agent for procedures, i.e. dental procedures, labour. Delivered via nasal mask along with oxygen. 

## Complications [^1] [^3] [^4]
- Can lead to cardiovascular depression in patients with prior myocardial dysfunction or patients in shock. 
- FiO2 of delivered gas must be reduced to administer nitrous oxide, which will lead to less pre-oxygenation
- Diffusion hypoxia can occur once nitrous oxide delivery is stopped as it can dilute the oxygen held in the alveoli by releasing nitrous oxide stores in the body. 
- There is an increased risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting associated with use of nitrous oxide.
