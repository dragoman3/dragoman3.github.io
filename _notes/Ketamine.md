# What is Ketamine?
- Rapidly acting NMDA receptor antagonist that can be used for [[Induction of General Anesthesia]], sedation, and [[Pain Management]]

# Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Ketamine acts in a *noncompetitive* antagonistic mechanism of the NMDA receptor
- Secondary effects at the opiate, muscarinic, cholinergic and serotonergic receptors 

# Pharmacodynamics [^1] [^2] [^3]
## Cardiovascular 
- Inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. 
	- Transient increase in HR, BP, SVR
	- Can lead to increased coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen demand. 
- Generally, ketamine is a hemodynamically stable induction agent. If a patient is sick and has little catecholamine reserves, hypotension can occur with administration

## Respiratory
- Minimal impact on respiratory drive & minute ventilation 
- airway reflexes preserved; however, large doses can lead to an impaired airway
- Produces  bronchodilation 
- Increases airway secretions

## Central Nervous System
- Increases cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow thereby increasing cerebral vasodilation 
- Cataleptic state **without amnesia** can occur 
	- hallucinations, delirium, dissociative are all possible
- Anticonvulsant properties  
- Increased tone which can manifest as myoclonic contraction and vocalization 

# Indications [^3]
## Anesthetic Indications
- [[Induction of General Anesthesia]]
- Short term sedation and analgesia during procedures or other clinical indications 
- [[Pain Management]]

## Other Indications 
- Treatment of refractory depression and suicidal ideation 
- Widely used in the emergency department in short cases requiring short term anesthetic, such as fracture reductions 

# Dosing [^2]
- Induction doses are 1 - 2 mg/kg IV or 3-5 mg/kg IM 
- Analgesia doses are 0.15 - 0.25 mg/kg IV as a push or 0.1-0.3 mg/kg/hour 
- Half-life of redistribution = 11 - 16 minutes
- Half-life of elimination = 2 - 4 hours 

# Complications  [^2] [^3]
- dysphoria at intermediate dosing can be profound
	- analgesic doses generally tolerated well, high doses lead to complete sedation
- Most commonly, patients can experience nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and confusion 
- Increased muscular tone with myoclonic contractions resembling seizures 
- Use with caution in cardiac disease due to stimulatory effects
