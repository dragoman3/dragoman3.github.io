## What is Morphine? [^1]
- Naturally occurring opioid analgesic derived from the opium poppy.
- Used for the management of moderate to severe pain.

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Primarily acts on mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) to produce analgesia.
- Onset in 30-60 minutes (PO) and 15 minutes (IV), with a half-life of 2-3 hours. [^4]
- Metabolized in the liver by glucuronidation, producing morphine-3-glucuronide (inactive) and morphine-6-glucuronide (active), the latter of which has potent analgesic effects.
  - Morphine-6-glucuronide can accumulate in renal failure, potentially causing prolonged sedation and respiratory depression. [^1]
- Excreted primarily through the kidneys.

## Pharmacodynamics [^1][^2]
### Cardiovascular
- May cause mild to moderate hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation (in part due to histamine release)
- Can also cause bradycardia due to its effects on the parasympathetic nervous system.

### Respiratory
- Depresses respiratory centers in the brainstem, leading to decreased respiratory rate and minute ventilation. Often, compensatory increased tidal volume occurs. [^1]
- Risk of respiratory depression increases with dose and concomitant use of other CNS depressants.

## Indications [^1]
- [[Pain Management]]: Management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate.
- Also used for relief of dyspnea in palliative care and management of myocardial infarction-related pain.

## Dosage [^2]
- **Oral:** 
  - 10 to 30 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain.
- **Intravenous (IV):**
  - 2.5 to 10 mg every 2 to 4 hours as needed for pain.
  - 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg in pediatrics (IV). [^5]
- **Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA):**
  - Initial demand dose: 1 mg IV; lockout interval typically 6 to 10 minutes.
- Dosage should be adjusted based on the patient's response, tolerance, and severity of pain.

## Contraindications [^1][^2]
- Hypersensitivity to morphine or any of its components.
- Severe respiratory depression without resuscitative equipment or monitoring.

## Complications [^1][^2][^3]
- Respiratory depression
- Common opioid-related side effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, and sedation.
- Risk of hypotension, especially in patients with compromised blood pressure or on concomitant medications that lower blood pressure.
- Risk of prolonged sedation in patients with renal impairment due to accumulation of morphine-6-glucuronide.
