## What is Naloxone? [^1]
- A pure opioid antagonist used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose, including respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension.

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1]
- *Competitively* binds to mu, delta, kappa, and sigma opioid receptors in the CNS, reversing or preventing opioid effects.
- Has a rapid onset of action within 1-2 minutes (IV) and a short duration of 30-60 minutes.
- Metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys.

## Pharmacodynamics [^1]
### Cardiovascular
- Rapid reversal of opioids can cause hypertension, tachycardia, and even pulmonary edema or arrhythmias in severe cases.

### Respiratory
- Effectively reverses opioid-induced respiratory depression, restoring normal respiration.
- Rapid administration can precipitate withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent individuals.

## Indications [^1]
- Reversal of opioid overdose, particularly in cases of respiratory depression.
- Perioperative management of excessive sedation or respiratory depression due to opioids.

## Dosage 
- **Intravenous (IV):**
  - Initial dose: 0.04 to 0.1 mg IV every 1-2 minutes to effect.
  - 0.25-0.5 mcg/kg in pediatrics [^2]
- **Intramuscular (IM):**
  - 0.4 mg IM; may repeat as necessary.
- **Intranasal:**
  - 4 mg as a single spray in one nostril; may repeat as necessary.
- **IV Infusion:**
  - 3-10 mcg/kg/hr

## Contraindications [^1]
- Hypersensitivity to naloxone or any of its components.
- Use with caution in opioid-dependent patients, as it may precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms.

## Complications [^1]
- Acute opioid withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and hypertension.
- Risk of pulmonary edema, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions.
- Reversal of analgesia, leading to the return of pain.
