## What is Dexamethasone?
- Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid used in the perioperative period for [[Post-operative Nausea and Vomiting]] and airway swelling.

## Mechanism of Action [^1][^2]
- Dexamethasone binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors inhibiting inflammatory mediators.
- Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and causes antiemetic effect. 

## Indications [^1][^2]
- **Antiemetic:** Prevention and treatment of [[Post-operative Nausea and Vomiting]] (PONV).
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Often used in ENT and airway surgery to reduce the risk of swelling.
- **Cerebral Edema:** Reduction of intracranial pressure, generally reserved for brain tumors

## Dosage [^2]
- **PONV:** 0.1 mg/kg IV up to 4-6 mg [^2]
- **Inflammatory:** Dose depends on clinical scenario, but 0.1-0.2 mg/kg up to ~10mg is common.

## Pharmacokinetics [^1]
- **Onset of Action:** 2-4 hours
- **Half-life:** 36-54 hours.
- **Metabolism:** Hepatic
- **Excretion:** Metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.

## Complications [^2]
- **Hyperglycemia**
- **Adrenal Suppression:** Generally risk increases with prolonged use.
- **Perineal Pain:** Rapid injection in awake patients often results in perineal pain.
