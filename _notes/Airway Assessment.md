# Introduction
Every patient coming for anesthesia requires an airway assessment. The goal of the airway assessment is to determine the ease of bag-mask ventilation (BMV), tracheal intubation, LMA placement and emergency front of neck access (FONA). FONA is beyond the scope of this review card but is available in the listed references.  

# Airway Evaluation [^2]
## Overview
1. History of difficult intubation
2. Mouth opening
3. Mallampati score
4. Thyromental distance
5. Mandibular protrusion 
6. Neck circumference
7. Neck range of motion
8. Status of dentition
9. NPO status

*As seen below, the elements of the airway exam can raise suspicion for difficulty with airway manipulation*

## Mallampati Score [^3]

## Predictors of Difficult Bag Mask Ventilation [^1]
*Santa Claus*
1. Beard & facial hair
2. Obesity (BMI >35)
3. Neck circumference (>44cm)
4. Edentureless
5. Sleep apnea

## Predictors of Difficult Direct Laryngoscopy [^1]

1. Mallampati 3&4
2. **Thyromental distance < 6cm**
3. **Limited C-spine extension**
4. **Limited mouth opening**
5. OSA or thick neck
6. Increased BMI (conflicting results)
7. Previous neck radiation
8. **Limited mandibular protrusion**
9. **Male sex**

## Predictors of Difficult Video Laryngoscopy [^1]
1. History of difficult direct laryngoscopy
2. **Thyromental distance < 6cm**
3. **Limited C-spine extension**
4. **Limited mouth opening**
5. Soiled airway
