## What is Hydromorphone? [^1]
- Semi-synthetic opioid analgesic derived from morphine.
- Used for the management of moderate to severe pain.

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Primarily acts on mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) to produce analgesia.
- Onset in 30-60 minutes (PO) and 10-15 minutes (IV), half life 2-3 hours [^4]
- Binds to opioid receptors leading to inhibition of ascending pain pathways, altering the perception of and response to pain.
- Metabolized in the liver by glucuronidation, producing dihydromorphine and dihydroisomorphine (active) and hydromorphone-3-glucuronide (inactive)
	- hydromorphone-3-glucuronide can accumulate in renal failure which can cause cognitive effects and neuroexcitation [^2]
- Excreted primarily through the kidneys.

## Pharmacodynamics [^1][^2]
### Cardiovascular
- Can cause mild to moderate hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation.
- Minimal effects on myocardial contractility, but may cause bradycardia in some patients.

### Respiratory
- Depresses respiratory centers in the brainstem, leading to decreased respiratory rate and minute ventilation. Often compensatory increased tidal volume occurs [^1]
- Risk of respiratory depression increases with dose and concomitant use of other CNS depressants.

## Indications [^1]
- Management of moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate.
- Often used in postoperative pain management, cancer pain, and severe acute pain.

## Dosage [^2]
- **Oral:** 
  - 2 to 4 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain.
- **Intravenous (IV):**
  - 0.2 to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours as needed for pain.
  - 5-15 mcg/kg in pediatrics
- **Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA):**
  - Initial demand dose: 0.1 to 0.2 mg IV; lockout interval typically 6 to 10 minutes.
- Dosage should be adjusted based on the patient's response, tolerance, and severity of pain.

## Contraindications [^1][^2]
- Hypersensitivity to hydromorphone or any of its components.
- Severe respiratory depression without resuscitative equipment or monitoring.

## Complications [^1][^2][^3]
- Respiratory depression, which can be severe and life-threatening, especially in opioid-naive patients.
- Common opioid-related side effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, pruritus, and sedation.
- Long-term use may lead to tolerance, physical dependence, and opioid use disorder.
- Risk of hypotension, especially in patients with compromised blood pressure or on concomitant medications that lower blood pressure.
