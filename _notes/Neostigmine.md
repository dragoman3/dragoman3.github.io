## What is Neostigmine?
- Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor generally used to reverse non-depolarizing muscle relaxants like [[DrugLibrary/Rocuronium|Rocuronium]] 

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- **Mechanism of Action:** Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine => Leads to enhanced stimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.
- **Secondary Effects:** Leads to muscarinic receptor stimulation, which can lead to bradycardia, increased secretions, and bronchospasm. Glycopyrrolate can reduce these effects.

## Pharmacodynamics [^1][^2]
### Cardiovascular
- Bradycardia due to its stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.

### Respiratory
- Can cause bronchospasm due to stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscles.

## Indications [^1][^2]
### Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade
- Used to reverse the effects of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NDMRs) like [[DrugLibrary/Rocuronium|Rocuronium]]  and vecuronium.
- Works by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, outcompeting the NDMRs

## Dosing [^1][^2]
- **Reversal of NDMR:** 0.03 - 0.07 mg/kg IV, usually administered with glycopyrrolate to mitigate muscarinic side effects.
- Due to the side effects of neostigmine, often the dose does not exceed 3mg.
- The ratio of neostigmine to Glycopyrrolate is 5:1. 

## Complications  [^1][^2]
- **Bradycardia:** Often requires co-administration of an anticholinergic agent like glycopyrrolate.
- **Bronchospasm:** Due to stimulation of muscarinic receptors.
- **Gastrointestinal:** Nausea, vomiting, and increased gastrointestinal motility.
