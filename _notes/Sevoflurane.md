## What is Sevoflurane?
- Volatile inhaled anesthetic agent used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. 
- It is synthetic, colourless and non-flammable

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1] [^2]
- There is no confirmed mechanism of action 
- Theories include possible activity on GABA receptors, calcium channels, or glutamate

## Pharmacodynamics [^1] [^2]
### Cardiovascular
- Dose-related reduction in blood pressure due to a decrease in SVR

### Respiratory
- Has bronchodilation properties so can be used to treat individuals with status asthmaticus. 
- Less likely to elicit airway irritation symptoms such as coughing and laryngospasm compared to [[DrugLibrary/Desflurane|Desflurane]] and isoflurane due to low pungency.

### Central Nervous System
- Dose-related vasodilatory effects of cerebral vasculature so it increases cerebral blood flow and ICP.

### Other
-  Known to produce uterine relaxation which can be used in specific cases such as retained placenta but can be detrimental during other procedures such as a D&C. 

## Indications [^1] 
- Used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. 
- Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is used to compare the potencies between various volatile agents. 

## Complications [^1] [^2]
- Should not be used for anesthetic management in patients with known history of malignant hyperthermia or suspected susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. 
- Increased risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting compared to intravenous anesthetic agents.
