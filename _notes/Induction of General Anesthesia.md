# Introduction
*The start of a case represents one of the highest risk periods in the operation.*

After a surgical time-out, the tools required for a safe induction can be remembered with the *MDSOLES* acronym:
- Monitors
- Drugs
	- IV access
	- induction agents
	- resuscitation medications (vasopressors, reversal agents)
- Suction
- Oxygen (primary and alternative source)
- Laryngoscope
- ETT
- Stylet

# Goals of Induction
## Loss of consciousness
*Anesthetic agents are administered until the patient loses consciousness. The speed at which anesthesia is induced is often guided by the clinical scenario and patient comorbidities (see [[Rapid Sequence Induction]])*

Tests of loss of consciousness:
- loss of verbal or pain response
- loss of eyelash reflex
- apnea (often used when using [[Propofol]] or other apnea-inducing agents)

## Hemodynamic Stability
*There are many factors that contribute to hemodynamic depression and elevation. Hypotension is a common side effect of anesthetic agents and should be expected and counteracted. Similarly, laryngoscopy can be quite stimulating and achieving sympathetic blockade with narcotics or other medications is standard.*

Factors causing hypotension:
- anesthetic agents & analgesics
- administration of positive pressure ventilation (due to reducing preload)
- patient positioning (head up reduces preload, head down will augment preload)

Factors causing hypertension
- jaw thrust
- laryngoscopy
- surgical incision

## Facilitation of Airway Management
*Depending on the desired airway, there are a variety of medications that can assist in placement of an airway device.*
See [[Airway Devices]]
### Endotracheal Tube
- Paralysis with [[Succinylcholine]] or [[Rocuronium]] is common
- Narcotics like [[Remifentanil]] or [[Fentanyl]] can improve the grade of the view during laryngoscopy and prevent the hemodynamic impact of laryngoscopy
- Adequate depth of anesthetic can facilitate intubation

### Supraglottic Airway
- Depth of anesthetic is important for placement of an SGA
- Paralysis and narcotics can be used to facilitate SGA placement but paralysis is often unnecessary
