#### Monitoring
After insertion, ASA taskforce for obstetrical anesthesia  recommends monitoring FHR (since you are administering epidural opioid).
BP should be cycled q1-2min following epidural administration.
Select patients with higher risk of obstruction should be placed on the sat monitor.
#### Consent
Contraindications related to  instrumenting spine:
- bleeding diasthesis
- infection at site or possibly disseminated bloodborne infection
- increased intraranial pressure

Contraindications related to local anesthetic:
- severe hypovolemia
- allergy to local anesthetic

Discuss risks early in labor. No difference in remembering complications in women in pain vs not in pain [^1]



## Anatomy
Spinal cord ends at level L1-L2 in most adults, subarachnoid space ends around S2 [^1].
### Epidural space
Contains loose CT, adipose, spinal nerve roots, vertebral plexus (Batson's Plexus).
There can be variations, like dorsal median CT band and discontinuities that cause incomplete or unilateral blocks.
### Posterior space
Ligamentum flavum (fused along the midline, actually 2 ligaments).
Interspinous and supraspinous ligaments are posterior to this.
### Likely Skin-to-Space Distance:
Depends on BMI, race
![[Pasted image 20211020115236.png]]

### Optimal Distance to Thread Catheter
- Most evidence indicates that the traditional distance of 2-3cm leads to increased risk of dislodgment, especially in laboring parturients
- Too short = dislodgement
- Too far = unilateral block 
- 5-6cm is the usual recommendation based on current evidence [^13] [^14]
- Additionally, no strong evidence between threading catheter and 'pulling it back to 5-6cm' vs 'placing at 5-6cm' [^15]

### Changes during pregnancy
> Dosage is affecte by 1. The volume of CSF that pregnant women have and 2. the density of CSF in a pregnant woman.
 ![[Pasted image 20211212204228.png]]
 From Chestnut 5th ed. 

#### Blood and CSF changes
Epidural veins are engorged due to uterine enlargement and vena caval compression.
Pregnant women have a lower dose requirement for neuraxial possibly because of the decreased CSF volume in pregnancy
Pregnant women have a lower specific gravity of CSF compared to non-pregnant patients. [^1]
#### Anatomical differences
1.  Â Pelvic rotation during pregnancy causes the line of the iliac crest to be more cephalad than normal
	1.  this line represents the L3-L4 interspace **rather** than the L4-L5 space	
2.  Less space between spinous processes in pregnancy
3.  Apex of lumbar lordosis is shifted **Caudad** in pregnancy. Thoracic Kyphosis is reduced.

## Complications
### Common
[[Bezold-Jarish Reflex]]
### Uncommon

Infections of the epidural space often lead to [[160.2 Epidural Abscess]]
Most common is S.Aureus. Meningitis is mostly caused here by S. Viridins (resp tract, vaginal tract)

See also [[161.3 Epidural Hematoma]]

#### Post-Dural Puncture Headache
- Rates of accidental dural puncture are ~0.5% [^11]
- Incidence of PDPH after an accidental dural puncture with a 17G Tuohy are ~50% [^12]
- See [[Post-Dural Puncture Headache]]

## [[Tunneled Epidural]]
# Epidural Medications
Common solutions
Bupivicaine and hydromorphone
- hydromorphone 8mcg/mL, bupivicaine 0.1%. 
- hydromorphone doses can range from 4mcg/mL to 20mcg/mL
bupivicaine (0.1 mg/mL) 
See [[Hydromorphone]]
### Epidural Opioids
See [[Anesthesia Topics/Opioid Physiology]]
Bind to the pre- and post-synaptic opioid receptors in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn and to brainstem opioid receptors.

These can cause respiratory depression via mu_2 receptor activation early on. Later (up to 24 hrs), the hydrophilic opioids can spread cephalad to cause depression.

Opioids are synergistic with local anesthetic which gives a more dense block while limiting the side effects of the LA (like hypotension)

The opioid component greatly improves the component of *visceral analgesia*

#### Subtleties of Fentanyl & Hydromorphone
See also 

Since fentanyl is so lipophilic, it will spread *less* than hydromorphone. This is better for *small incisions*.

Whereas hydromorphone is a more appropriate choice for longer incisions, which will benefit from larger spread.
### Adrenergic Agonists
Believed to act through $alpha_2$ activation in the dorsal horn. These mimic the descending inhibitory pain signals.

### Local anesthetics
See [[Local Anesthetic]]
Diffuse onto the spinal cord, dorsal and ventral nerve routes, and the spinal nerve itself. They act preferentially on Type A Delta + unmyelimnated Type C nerves preferentially [[Nerve Fiber Types]] but at higher concentrations will effect Type A Alpha motor function. We tend to use low dose **Bupivicaine (0.8%) and/or Ropivicaine ** due to their prefential blockade of sensory (Type A Delta/Type C) versus motor fibers. Lidocaine would lead to a more intense motor block hence, it's use for instrumentation / c-section top-ups (2% Lidocaine w/ Epi). 

## Test Dose
- The use of a test is somewhat controversial in the modern era. Previously, it had much more rationale as the instance of intravascular and/or intrathecal catheters were much higher (stiffer catheters, differences in technique etc.) and the doses of local anesthestic used were substantially higher resulting in legitimate concern if a catheter was malpositioned
- Traditionally, a test dose of 30-60mg of Lidocaine w/ Epinephrine was used and patient's were monitored for a complete motor block (intrathecal) or a increase in HR > 10 or more (intravascular). It has been demonstrated that using epinephrine and measuring HR increases is not sensitive nor specific in this context.
- 30-60mg of Lidocaine (1.5-3cc of 2%) is typically used as if the catheter is intrathecal you would except an immediate motor block & if it is intravascular you should get some signs of systemic local anesthestic. Some anesthesiologists will argue that administering Lidocaine as a test is suboptimal as we know there is a higher risk of transient neurologic symptoms (TNS) if Lidocaine is intrathecal and instead you should use 7.5-15mg Bupivicaine (spinal dose) to test. Yet, TNS is more likely with large >100mg Lidocaine doses and you could make the argument that Bupivicaine is a more toxic agent if your catheter happens to intravascular (which occurs more frequently, some estimates are 7-8.5%[^1]). 
- One of the best tests of an intravascular catheter is administering fentanyl (~100mcg) as patients should experience sigificant drowsiness, dizziness, & respiratory depression [^8]. Dizziness had the highest sensitvity & specificity [^9]. Fentanyl is typically incorporated into the loading dose so monitor for immediate symptoms. 
- Additionally, aspirating on the catheter prior to injection is prudent and has decent evidence
- Altogether, no perfect test dose exists and you should follow the old saying *"every dose is a test dose"* -Dr Pytka

## Loading dose
- Zahid's Method
    - Take 8mL Saline into 20mL syringe
    - Add 2 cc of 50mcg/mL fentanyl (100mcg)
    - 10mL 0.25% bupivicaine
    - Final Concentration:
        - 0.125% bupivacaine
        - 5 mcg/mL fentanyl
        - Give 10-20cc bolus as loading dose

## Setting- PIEB vs Continuous
**Patient Initiated Epidural Bolus (PIEB)**
- Not  a new concept but pump technology precluded ability to safely initiate 
- Cadaver studies support theory that PIEB provides more dispersed block, higher levels, and less dense sacral pooling [^6]. The suggestion would be that PIEB would result in more consistent blocks, less motor block in sacral roots (vaginal wall), resulting in more precipituous labor and more controlled vaginal delivery [^7]
![[Pasted image 20211212193818.png]]
- Strong evidence that it reduces instrument delivery, time of 2nd stage labor, increased maternal satisfaction, less local anesthestic dose, trend for reduced c-section rates [^3] [^4] [^5] [^7]
- Anectodally, some staff/nursing find them to be less reliable, particularly at the time of delivery or if instrumentation is needed but this is not supported by the evidence. It may be that instrumentation may be more difficult in the cases it does occur BUT it occurs much less often (per the literature)
- Another criticism has been the schedule of boluses and timing for top-ups & emergency c-sections but there's no evidence to support the notion you cannot give additional top-ups based on the a recent PIEB bolus dose (the overall amount of local anesthestic is probably less than what would be on board with continuous)

![[Pasted image 20211212194531.png]]
*Figure 1.* From Carvalho et al [^7] demonstrating how the epidural pump safely delivers the anesthetic regimen. 

** Dosing**
- Decent evidence for variety of regimens (see below)
- PIEB= 8cc 
- Bolus Interval = 45 minutes
- Next bolus = 30 minutes
- PCEA dose = 5-6cc 
 ![[Pasted image 20211212195236.png]]

** Continuous**
 - Traditional setting of constant rate in cc/hr
 - Provides adequate analgesia, trend is to start using PIEB as evidence supports it's use (above)
 
** Dosing**
 - Rate= 6-10cc/hour
 - PCEA dose = 5cc
 - Lockout = 10 minutes

## Determinants of Epidural spread
Followed from [^2]
Local anesthetic spreads both caudally and cephalad (although more cephalad)
Another explanation of the phenomenon is that more cranial nerve routes tend to be *smaller*. Older patients tend to have higher spread (2/2 reduced epidural fat?)
Concentration affects the density of the block.
The volume effects the spread of the block. 

> Generally, use 1-2mL of local anesthetic per dermatome to be blocked.
