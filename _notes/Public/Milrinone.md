## Mechanism of Action
Competitive inhibitory action of PDE III that decrease the hydrolysis of cAMP leading to increase intracellular concentrations of cAMP in the myocardium and vascular smooth muscle
Myocardium effect: increased inward calcium and contractility
cAMP: increases inotropy, chronotropy, dromotropy


### Inodilators
increased contractility, increased cardiac output and decrease LVEDP in addition to increased venous capacitance

## Physiology
70% protein bound
must be renally adjusted
## Indications
-  [[Subarachnoid Hemorrhage]] to prevent cerebral vasodilation
- Acute ventricular dysfunction - increases CO and decreased afterload
- Chronic CHF
	- downregulation of B1 receptors
	- symptomatic benefit, unclear effect on mortality
- [[Pulmonary Hypertension]]
## Dosage
Bolus: 50mcg/kg bolus over 10 min
Maintenance: 0.25-0.75mcg/kg/min
Max daily dose 1.3mg/kg/day


## Complications
Hypotension as a result of vasodilation
Potentially pro-arrhythmic if given too quickly

### Comparison to [[Dobutamine]]
Milrinone may be more effective at reducing filling pressures
Milrinone usually doesn't cause tachycardia
