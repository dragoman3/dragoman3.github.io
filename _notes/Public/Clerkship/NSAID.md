## Examples

[[Ketorolac]]
## Complications
Generally, the complications are a result of inhibiting COX-1
- Dyspepsia, GIT ulceration
- Platelet dysfunction
- Renal impairment by inhibiting PG induced vasodilation of afferent glomerular arterioles

Inhibition of COX-2 has been linked to several adverse cardiac outcomes.
