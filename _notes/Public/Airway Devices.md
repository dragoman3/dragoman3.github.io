# Oropharyngeal Airway
Useful for maintaining airway patency
Sizing: corner of mouth to angle of mandible
Contraindications: beware in pediatrics (due to incompletely formed hard palate)
# Nasopharyngeal Airway
Also known as a nasal trumpet
Used to maintain airway patency
Sizing: tip of nose to earlobe
Contraindications: **Basal skull fracture**, patients likely to have epistaxis (relative)
# Laryngeal Mask Airway
A supraglottic (does not pass below vocal cords) airway device which can be used to maintain an airway under anesthesia or in an emergency situation. These devices do not provide the level of seal that an ETT does

## Indications
- anesthetic cases with: 
	- good access to the airway (to swap to ETT, if needed) 
	- positioning amenable to low airway pressures
	- generally, no laparopscopic component
- Patients at risk of laryngospasm/bronchospasm
	- less invasive and provoking than an ETT
## Contraindications
### Patient Factors
- Severe GERD
- Obesity
	- due to higher pressures required
### Surgical
- laparoscopic (generally)
- shared airway with limited access to manage airway
## Sizing
These are **weight** based and vary by type LMA
# Endotracheal Tube
## Placement
Standard endotracheal tubes are placed below the level of the vocal cords under direct vision.
On x-ray, the tube tip should sit 2-4 cm above the carina.
A rule of thumb for the depth of tube is:
$$Depth = 3\times Tube~Diameter$$
## Sizing
Tube diameter is generally selected with the following rule for cuffed tubes:
$$Tube~Diameter = (age + 4)/4$$


## Specialized Endotracheal Tubes

### RAE tubes
Stands for: Ring, Adair, Elwyn
Charicteristic bend removes tube and circuit from surgical field
Useful in: Sinus surgery, facial surgery
Special considerations: Fixed length from bend to tip of tube can impair proper tube placement below glottis
### Nasal RAE

Special Considerations:  
- Fixed length from bend to tip of tube can impair proper tube placement below glottis

### Cuffed vs Uncuffed
Generally cuffed tubes are used unless in very small pediatric populations
