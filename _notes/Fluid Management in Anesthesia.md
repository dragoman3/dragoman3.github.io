# Introduction
It is helpful to have an idea of how much fluid a patient should receive during an operation. Below are some rules of thumb to calculate the expected needs of a patients. Fluids should be thought of as a medication and response to fluids should be monitored (urine output, blood pressure & heart rate response, biochemical improvement)
## Fluid Requirements
Maintenance fluids can be estimated by the 4-2-1 rule:

| **Weight Range**          | **Fluid Rate Calculation** | **Hourly Fluid Rate**                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| First 10 kg               | 4 mL/kg/hr                 | 40 mL/hr                             |
| Next 10 kg (11-20 kg)     | 2 mL/kg/hr                 | 40 mL + (2 mL × weight over 10 kg)   |
| Above 20 kg               | 1 mL/kg/hr                 | 60 mL + (1 mL × weight over 20 kg)   |

### Example Calculations:
- **Patient weighing 15 kg**:
  - First 10 kg: 4 mL × 10 = 40 mL
  - Next 5 kg: 2 mL × 5 = 10 mL
  - **Total hourly fluid rate** = 40 + 10 = **50 mL/hr**

- **Patient weighing 25 kg**:
  - First 10 kg: 4 mL × 10 = 40 mL
  - Next 10 kg: 2 mL × 10 = 20 mL
  - Above 20 kg: 1 mL × 5 = 5 mL
  - **Total hourly fluid rate** = 40 + 20 + 5 = **65 mL/hr**

## Allowable Blood Loss
Blood volume for a patient can be calculated as follows:
$$Blood~Volume = Weight (kg) \times Blood~Volume~per~kg$$

| Age Group            | Average Blood Volume (mL/kg) |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Adult man            | 75                           |
| Adult woman          | 65                           |
| Infant               | 80                           |

Using the final acceptable hemoglobin (Hgb_f, generally ~70), the starting hemoglobin (Hgb_i), and the blood volume, the allowable blood volume can be calculated as follows:

$$Allowable~Blood~Loss = Blood~Volume \times \frac{Hgb_i - Hgb_f}{Hgb_i}$$
