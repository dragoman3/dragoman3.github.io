## What is Propofol? [^1][^2]
- Sedative agent for induction and maintenance of anesthesia.
- Rapid redistribution allows brief, deep sedation (e.g., joint reductions, cardioversions, ECT).

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Exact mechanism is not fully understood, likely potentiates GABA receptors.
- Highly protein-bound and lipophilic, metabolized in the liver via conjugation, and excreted through the renal system.
- **Half-life:**
  - Redistribution: 2 - 8 minutes.
  - Elimination: 4 - 7 hours.

## Pharmacodynamics [^1][^2]
### Cardiovascular
- Decreases arterial blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance through arterial and venous vasodilation.
- Reduces preload, afterload, and cardiac output.
- Inhibits the baroreceptor response, preventing the compensatory increase in heart rate typically seen with hypotension.

### Respiratory
- Depresses respiratory drive, leading to dose-dependent apnea
- Inhibits hypoxia-mediated drive to breathe and reduces the ventilatory response to elevated CO2.
- Suppresses upper airway reflexes, facilitating tracheal intubation and LMA placement.
- Decreases tidal volume while increasing respiratory rate, with minimal impact on minute ventilation.

### Central Nervous System
- Decreases cerebral metabolic rate (CMR), cerebral blood flow (CBF), intracranial pressure (ICP), and intraocular pressure (IOP).
- Exhibits anticonvulsant properties and can be used in the treatment of refractory seizures.
- May result in a critical decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in patients with raised ICP, particularly if mean arterial pressure (MAP) drops significantly.

## Indications [^1][^2]
### Anesthetic Indications
- Induction and maintenance of general anesthesia (TIVA technique).
- Sedation during procedures (e.g., mechanical ventilation, intubation).

### Other Indications
- Treatment of refractory seizures.
- Treatment of refractory postoperative nausea and vomiting.

## Dosage [^2]
- **Induction Dose:** 1.5 - 2.5 mg/kg IV; reduced to 1 - 2 mg/kg in patients premedicated with opioids or benzodiazepines. Children may require higher induction doses (up to ~4 mg/kg).
- **Maintenance Dose:** 20 - 200 Âµg/kg/min IV infusion. See [TIVA](TIVA.md).
- **Half-life:** Redistribution: 2 - 8 minutes; Elimination: 4 - 7 hours.

## Complications [^1][^2]
- Pain on injection, often mitigated by co-administration of lidocaine.
- Hypotension, particularly in patients with reduced cardiovascular reserve or fixed cardiac output.
- Propofol infusion syndrome (rare but serious)
- QT prolongation (rare).
