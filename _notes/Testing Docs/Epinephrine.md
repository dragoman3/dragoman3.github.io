## Mechanism
Potent activator of $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ receptors

Mast cell stabilization

### Alpha-1
arteriolar vasoconstriction and pulmonary artery vasoconstriction
predominant in renal, cutaneous and splanchnic

### Beta-1
70% cardiac beta are beta 1
increases refraction period in bundle of his
increases automaticity in latent pacemakers

Induces increased HR, contractility, increased venous return
Increases rate of myocardial relaxation, improving diastolic function

*No* tachyphylaxis


### Beta-2
stimulation leads to vasodilation (mostly at skeletal muscles)
THese are more sensitive to epi at lower dosages

Causes smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary smooth muscle. Underlying beta blockade can cause epinephrine to cause pulmonary vasoconstriction (alpha)
## Physiology
Created and stored in adrenal medula

Poorly lipid soluble so minimal CNS 

### Renal effects
increases renin secretion
Renal blood flow is substantially reduced -> can cause an impaired clearance of lactate

### Hematology
Can cause a hypercoagulable state. Increases platelet aggregation and factor 5
### Gastrointestinal

### Metabolic Effects
Glycogenolysis 


#### Potassium levels
B2 activity causes increased intracellular potassium 

## Indications
bronchospasm
anaphylaxis

## Dosage
Higher doses of epinephrine lead to increasing alpha-1 (ie, afterload will eventually increase such that CO decreases )

1 mg (1:1000) epinephrine into 100mL bag giving **10mcg/mL**
Bolus Dosage: 5-10 mcg (rapidly increase dose PRN)
- 1mg IV push for ACLS
Infusion: 0.02 - 1 mcg/kg/min
	- lower dosage gives more $\beta$ activity (0.01 - 0.04 mcg/kg/min)
	- higher dosage affects $\alpha$ more (0.15-0.3 mcg/kg/min)


### Oral
Rapidly metabolized by gastric mucosa
