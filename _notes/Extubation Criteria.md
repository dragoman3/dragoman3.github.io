# Introduction
Below is a checklist to follow when considering extubating a patient. 

# Approach
## Airway
*Ensure the patient will be able to protect their own airway and that airway recapture is possible*
- protective reflexes are present (cough, gag)
- cuff leak is present (generally after long cases, surgeries near the neck, or Trendelenburg position)
- reintubation or ventilation is feasible (the difficulty of intubation can dictate how conservative extubation must be)

## Breathing
*Ensure the patient's respiratory drive is adequate for maintaining oxygenation and ventilation*
- the patient is **triggering** the ventilator
- the patient is drawing adequate tidal volumes and minute ventilation (this will be related to the amount of assistance the ventilator is delivering)
- the patient is triggering the ventilator at an appropriate respiratory rate (often targeting RR 10-12 at the end of a case)
- the patient has adequate gas exchange

## Circulation
*Ensure that the patient's hemodynamics are stable enough for extubation*
- change from positive pressure ventilation to negative pressure will be tolerated well
	- especially important in cardiac pathology and pulmonary hypertension
- added work of breathing will be tolerated hemodynamically

## Disability/Drugs
*Ensure the patient has a level of consciousness that is amenable to extubation. Similarly, ensure there are no drugs in the patient's system that may cause them to fail extubation*

- reversal of neuromuscular blockers (train of four > 90%)
- adequate analgesia on board
- condition requiring intubation has been resolved (if intubated in a non-elective setting)
- there is no patient condition that requires control of ventilation (ex. TBI protocol necessitates avoiding hypercapnia)
