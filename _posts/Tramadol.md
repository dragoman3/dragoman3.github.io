## What is Tramadol? [^1]
- Synthetic opioid with analgesic properties indicated for treatment of moderate-severe pain.
- Can be administered orally as immediate release or extended release tablets or as a liquid formulation.

## Mechanism of Action & Pharmacokinetics [^1][^2]
- Atypical synthetic opioid with synergistic opioid and non-opioid effects. Activates both the Î¼-opioid and monoamine receptor systems:
	- **Opioid**: Selectively binds to opiate receptors in the central nervous system. Tramadol is broken down to active metabolite M1 by liver enzyme CYP2D6. M1 is a more potent analgesic with stronger affinity for opiate receptors.
	- **Non-opioid/SNRI + SSRI**: The two enantiomers of tramadol each independently inhibit norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, which activate the inhibitory descending pathway - producing an antinociceptive effect with alteration of pain perception.
- Tramadol and its M1 metabolite reach maximum plasma concentration in 2 and 3 hours with a half-life of and 6 and 8 hours, respectively.
- Metabolized by liver enzymes through conjugation and metabolites are primarily renally excreted. 

## Dosage [^1][^3]
- Extended release: 100, 200, or 300 mg tablet once daily.
- Immediate release: 50 mg tablet or 5 mg/ml solution.
	- Acute pain: 50-100 mg every 4-6 hours with a daily maximum of 400 mg/d.

## Indications [^1][^2] 
- Moderate to severe pain. Commonly used postoperatively. 
- Extended release: pain lasting longer than a week.
- Immediate release: pain lasting less than a week, and not to be used "as needed" but rather with scheduling dosing. 

## Adverse effects  [^1][^2] [^3]
- As with other opiates, risk for development of tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, and abuse.
- Opioid side effects: nausea, pruritus, constipation, headache, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, sedation, respiratory depression, and death.
- Non-opioid effects: risk of seizures and serotonin syndrome especially when used with other drugs that act on the serotonergic system such as monoamine inhibitors. 
- Tramadol can cross the placenta and should be minimized in pregnancy to prevent fetal opioid exposure.
